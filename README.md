### My Role
I'm here to help you get things done.  I can track things down, remove blockers, answer questions, and do my best to explain
the bigger picture as I see it.  I want to see you succeed, in your current role, now, and wherever your career takes you.  

As a team, I want to work with people I enjoy spending time with.  I want to keep us vaguely pointed in the same direction, working together and helping each other move forward.

### Communication

Urgency Priority:
 * in-person
 * phone
 * text
 * IM
 * email

I like brevity.  Longer discussions or things that are intended for a wider audience or a longer life should be put in email (or a document) instead of IM.  Keep things clear, direct, and transparent.

If I'm wearing headphones, please use IM first unless it's urgent.

I'm an introvert, and in meetings am often not the first to jump up and say something, generally preferring some reflection.  I shoot for quality over quantity.

### Feedback

I like feedback and love some from my team.  I'll take negative feedback and my team should give it without fear of reprecussions.

Except for quick hits, I tend to prefer receiving it in regular private periods, such as 1:1's.

If you'd like more, please ask.

Generally, I strive to praise in public, and criticize in private.  I'll do my best to be clear.  When in doubt, especially wiht negative feedback, start with a thank-you, and give it more thought.  Feedback can lead to a discussion, but I'm happy to revisit it later if you'd like time to think for a discussion.

I've been told I have a tendency to stay away from superlatives, you may find you need to scale up my phrasing; my "pretty good" might be someone else's great.

From peers, I'm coming from a very different environment.  Any feedback on how to best succeed here is appreciated.  Catch my eye or pull me aside, and I'd love to grab a coffee.

### 1:1s

With respect to my team and reports, I like 1:1s on a weekly cadence.  Changing that is possible after some time.

I like the walking 1:1, so if you can help me figure out quiet routes outside, great.

For people that report to me, here's the standing agenda I like:
 * Whatever you want to talk about; the biggest issues taking up space in your head right now
 * Questions and requests for help from you, feedback for me
 * Follow ups from past 1:1s, and any relevant other projects
 * Any feedback I have for you
 * Issues I've got for you, be that requests for updates, knowledge transfer, or whatever discussions I want to lead

Feedback and career discussions will happen from time to time.
 
If specific prep is needed from you, I'll let you know.  I'll note action items for me, and expect you to do the same for you.  Followup on action items is expected.

I'm using 1:1's to build a relationship; as regular, scheduled, contact time where you can feel free to monopolize the agenda; and to ensure that we are taking the time to speak directly on a regular basis.

For me, from a 1:1 with my manager, I like to get an higher level view of what's happening on the team and the organization.  Happy to also work together through a tougher problem.

### Hours

I like M-F, 8:30 - 17:00.  I may be around on email or slack outside that time.  Unless previously discussed, or if there's an emergency, I don't expect you to respond to emails outside your regular hours.

For reports, I'm  fine with flexible hours, but like consistency and significant overlap amongst me and team members you work closely with.

### On Grumpiness

Grumpiness has lots of causes, generally stress or sleep related.    Generally, leaving the stresses of a small business with tight finances has done wonders for my grumpiness - it's hard to find something worse than payroll-making fears.

I'll do my best to hide it, but I might be shorter or quieter.

To deal with it, fresh air, a change of scenery, coffee or other BEvERages generally can help.


### About Me

I've cofounded a startup, and worked through its acquisition and the acquisition of its acquirer.  I miss that firehose sometimes.  In early 2018, my first child was born.  My daughter (and family) are taking more time, and I'm trying to lead a regular schedule to help spend time with her when she's awake.

### Baked Goods

Homemade is best, but something delicious from an independent baker is great too.   As for what, let's go with brownies.

### Where's this from?

I came across the idea for a readme strangely enough from some spam from techvibes (They used to share an office with us).  Seemed like a reasonable thing, so I took a first stab as I joined Clio.  More information here:
